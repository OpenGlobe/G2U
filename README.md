# G2U
Improving the government's hiring pipeline. 

## Food for thought

### Skills design
- How would you describe the way the world could look when governments and universities are working intentionally and effectively together to develop the competencies needed to ensure effective government management and effective delivery of services? 
- Describe a skill-building program or professional development experience in which you participated (or have heard about) that effectively builds the skills that are in the highest demand in government. What traits stood out? 
 
## Recruitment design
- How would you describe the way the world looks when governments and universities are working intentionally and effectively together to bring top talent into government organizations?
 
## Research design
- How would you describe the way the world looks when governments and universities are working intentionally and effectively together on research that meets the needs of scholars and practitioners? 
- For government practitioners: if you had a new research resource on staff, what are three priority research tasks/work streams you would ask them to take on? 
- For university partners/NGOs: if you had a magic wand and could access any existing government data set —that already exists but you do not currently have access to—what would it be and why?  Are there government officials you would want greater access to?

### Hopes and fears

One exercise I used a lot at the beginning of workshops was “hopes and fears”, as it helped get a sense for what folks were bringing to the table in terms of perceived limitations about a particular workshop or topic (“I’m worried that we’ll spend all this time coming up with ideas and then nothing will happen”, or “I hope that I can learn something that I can take back to improve my own dire hiring situation quickly”).

### The parking lot
 
And I sometimes found using the “parking lot” useful – as a way to capture stuff that might be interesting to explore later but might run the risk of derailing the conversation.
